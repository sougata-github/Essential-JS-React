# Essential JS React

This repository contains a JavaScript file, `script.js`, that covers essential JavaScript concepts you should understand before diving into React development.

## Concepts

- **Destructuring**: Unpack values from arrays or objects and assign them to distinct variables. This is crucial for understanding React's props and state management.

- **Rest & Spread Operator**: Spread operator in JavaScript, which is widely used in React for managing props and states.

- **Template Literals**: Understand how to create dynamic strings using template literals, a handy skill when working with JSX and rendering dynamic content in React.

- **Ternary Operator**: Ternary operator to write concise conditional statements in your React components, making your code more readable.

- **Arrow Functions**: Arrow functions, a fundamental part of modern JavaScript, and see how they are commonly used in React for defining component methods.

- **Short Circuiting**: Short-circuiting in JavaScript and how it can be applied to improve the efficiency of your React code.

- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: asynchronous code using promises, async/await, and callbacks. Asynchronous programming is crucial for handling data fetching and interactions in React applications.

- **Array Methods (map, filter, reduce)**: array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`. These methods are powerful for data manipulation and transformation in React projects.

**Note:** The explanations for each concept are provided as comments.
